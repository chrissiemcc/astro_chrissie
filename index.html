        Welcome to the astrochrissie website!
    </h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Chris, I did software engineering at Ulster University and I'm also a keen astronomer.<br>

            This has been my main hobby for nearly 4 years, in that time I have not only seen every major planet in
            the solar system through my telescope but also been collecting a photo of each, though just the sense of excitement
            you feel seeing Saturn's rings for the first time even took me by surprise and it was a quite majestic sight.<br>

            In future I'm intending to look into deep space for objects that the naked eye cannot even see.<br>
